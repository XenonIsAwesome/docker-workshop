# Level 1 | I thought this is a docker workshop??
This is indeed a docker workshop, but first we need to make something to containerize!

## Question
In C++:
1. Make an socket server that prints the data it receives.
2. Make a socket client that sends a constant buffer.

## Constraints
1. Must use CMake.
2. There must be two executeables, one for the server and one for the client.

## Additional notes
You may use any socket library for this to work.

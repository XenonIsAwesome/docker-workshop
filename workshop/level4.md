# Level 4 | Optimize! Optimize! Optimize!
Docker images are the opposite of lasagna, because you always want less layers.

## Question
You remember how I let you go wild in level 2?
Fun's over, time to optimize your bad dockerfile.

Make your docker image the minimum amount of layers.

## Constraints
1. Only 2 additional layer are allowed.
2. You must do everything in a single Dockerfile.

## Additional notes
> Hint: Research about multi-stage builds
